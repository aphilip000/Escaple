Project:
    The project is about a puzzle game.
    
    For every day there is a new puzzle to play with.

    At first, the player can only see the dimensions of the grid and the tile they started on (And maybe the end tile) 
    
    Tiles that the player passes over or interacts with are revealed

    Moves are notified using colors to identify whether it is a right move or not.
