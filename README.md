## Title: **Escaple**

## Collaborators

## About the Project
- It is a web based project built from HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Our project is still in its infancy, but we plan to create a fairly simple puzzle game inspired heavily by [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
- The basic idea is that the player must guide their character on a grid from one point to another by giving them a list of commands to follow
- Like in Wordle, the actual puzzle is not shown to the player until they have made guesses
- The player has a limited number of tries to reach the end
- Once the player has won or ran out of tries, the website will prompt them to post their results on some platform such as Twitter or Facebook
