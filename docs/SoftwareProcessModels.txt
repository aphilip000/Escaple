Discussion of Waterfall vs Agile Software Development Models

Method: Waterfall

Pros
    - Ensures each process is done correctly
    - Ideal for very important projects 
    - Ask the team members to look out for possible problems that can occur in future and find solutions to them before the development starts. 

Cons
    - Time consuming
    - Not ideal for a project with features and requirements not strictly specified earlier. 
    - Every step must be done in order
    - Not suitable for projects which need regular checking and updating.
    - Requires lots of planning in advance
    - More suitable for a larger development team than a group of 4


Method: Agile

Pros
    - Interactions and collaboration are more important for smaller, more inexperienced teams such as ours
    - Easy to go back and update, remove or add things.
    - Can be delivered incrementally
    - There will definitely be more similar products out there, so competition is ever changing
    - Can perform different steps of the project at the same time.
    - The Agile method provides chances for each member to use different programming skills during the interactions.
    - Can deliver fast.

Cons
    - Less straightforward plan as there are less preparations
    - Less planning in advance may result in a subpar product
    - Certain steps(principles) may receive less attention than others, resulting in a good product in some places but a bad one in others
